# Countries-API

Vanilla JS app, made with HTML/CSS/JS, design and API provided by front-end mentor, intermediate difficulty challenge. 
App will get JSON data from free API about 300+ countries, then it will map through all countries and display them on the screen with most common data like 
country flag, name, population, capital city and region. You can click on each country individually to open modal with new design and some more info like borders, languages, timezone etc.
You can also search for country by its name or filter countries by region they're in. Overall, not too complex app but still nice practice for working with APIs.
